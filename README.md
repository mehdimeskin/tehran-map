# tehran-map
It is vector file for tehran map based on municipality classifications (منطقه، محله)
tehran municipality has three main classifications for city: Mantaghe(منطقه), Nahie(ناحیه), Mahale(محله)
in this file we have created vector of each Mahale in Mantaghe folder
the vectors are produced manually with help of Tehran Map (mep.tehran.ir) in winter 1394. (there maybe some changes from municipality after that time)
every Mahale has polygon, name and color
This file is completely compatible with google map

I also provided a image for overall look.

this map is generated and used by Mamanpaz.ir team
